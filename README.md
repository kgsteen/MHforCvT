# MHforCvT
A Python script for calculating  𝐶 𝑣 ( 𝑇 ) C  v ​  (T) curves from the output of canonical simulations across a range of temperatures ( 𝑁 𝑡 N  t ​  ). This tool processes simulation data and computes thermodynamic properties, providing a detailed analysis of the heat capacity as a function of temperature.
